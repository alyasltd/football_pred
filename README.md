# ‚öΩÔ∏è football_pred Project

Hi! I‚Äôm a young woman passionate about football and currently studying Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and AI. This project is a fusion of my love for the beautiful game and my academic pursuits. I‚Äôm excited to share it with you, and I hope you‚Äôll enjoy it as much as I do! üòä

## First Step: YOLOv8 Players Detection and Segmentation üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚öΩÔ∏è

### What is the YOLOv8 Model?
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a cutting-edge object detection model that enables real-time detection and segmentation of objects in images and videos. It‚Äôs widely used in various domains, from autonomous driving to sports analytics, due to its exceptional speed and accuracy.

For more details on YOLOv8, you can check out the official documentation [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

### How Does It Work?
YOLOv8 operates by dividing an image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. The model processes these predictions to determine the objects present in the image and their locations. For segmentation tasks, YOLOv8 can also predict a mask for each object, allowing precise outlining of each player on the football field.

#### Architecture Details üß†
The YOLOv8 architecture is built upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone, typically a CSPDarknet, which extracts essential features from the input image. This backbone is followed by a neck, often a PANet or FPN, that enhances feature fusion from different scales. Finally, the head of the network is responsible for predicting bounding boxes, class probabilities, and object masks. The architecture's end-to-end design allows for efficient processing, making it well-suited for real-time applications like player detection and segmentation.

### Our Goal and How We'll Achieve It üéØ
The goal of this step is to accurately detect and segment football players on the field using YOLOv8. We‚Äôll begin by training the YOLOv8 model on a curated dataset of football match footage. After fine-tuning the model, it will be capable of identifying and segmenting players in real-time, laying the groundwork for further analysis like offside detection.

The dataset I'll be using is from Kaggle: [Football Player Detection YOLOv8](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iasadpanwhar/football-player-detection-yolov8).

Here's an example of what I want to achieve:

### Results üìä
After training and testing our YOLOv8 model, we‚Äôve achieved promising results in detecting and segmenting players. The model successfully identifies players on the field, even under challenging conditions like crowded scenes or varying lighting. These results are a solid foundation for building more advanced features in the app, such as offside detection, player tracking, and tactical analysis.

## Second Step: OFF-SIDE Detection üö©

*Nothing for now!* But stay tuned as I continue to develop this feature. It will leverage our player detection capabilities to automatically detect offside situations during a football match. This step will involve advanced techniques in computer vision and rule-based AI to make this feature a reality. ‚öôÔ∏è
